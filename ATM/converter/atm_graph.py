"""
ATMGraph --- class that represents an Alternating Turing Machine as a multi-graph. Specifically, this graph has
specific attributes for the information of the ATM other than the transition function and states which are represented 
as a multi-graph. Furthermore, the multi-graph represents a transition delta(q,a) = (p, b, d) by having an edge q -> p 
with weight (a, b, d). Also, each state is a vertex of the graph. We assume any symbol on a transition not in the input
alphabet is in the tape alphabet.
